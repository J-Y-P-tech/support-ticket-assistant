"""Shared enumerations for triage, ticket lifecycle, sources, and feedback.

These are the single source of truth for the closed value sets the whole system
exchanges. `Urgency`, `TicketStatus`, `SourceKind`, and `FeedbackDecision` are
copied verbatim from SPEC (§4.3, §5, §4.4, §4.9). `Category` and `Sentiment` are
not enumerated in SPEC; their values were confirmed with the user (2026-07-06).

Every enum is a `StrEnum`, so a value serializes to its plain string in JSON and
compares equal to that string, while still validating a closed set on input.
